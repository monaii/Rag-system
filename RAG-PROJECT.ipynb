    "# 📄 Project Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a lightweight and modular AI framework for the **automatic search and validation of documentary content** using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is designed for corporate environments where policies, procedures, technical manuals, and compliance documents must be checked for the presence of **specific requirements** (e.g., ISO 27001 controls).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ Core capabilities\n",
    "- **Document ingestion** from PDF, DOCX, PPTX, and TXT  \n",
    "- **Semantic chunking + embeddings** using OpenAI or fully local LLMs (Ollama)  \n",
    "- **Persistent vector database** (Chroma) for fast semantic retrieval  \n",
    "- **RAG-based question answering**, strictly grounded in retrieved context  \n",
    "- **Requirement validation module** that returns:  \n",
    "  - *present / not present / uncertain*  \n",
    "  - justification  \n",
    "  - evidence (source chunks)  \n",
    "- **Hallucination mitigation** using a secondary verification step  \n",
    "- **Optional LangGraph workflow**, modeling the pipeline as nodes  \n",
    "  (retrieve → generate → verify)\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Goal\n",
    "The goal is to demonstrate how modern LLMs + semantic search can **automate manual document review**, reduce human error, and provide **consistent, auditable compliance checking** in corporate settings.\n"
